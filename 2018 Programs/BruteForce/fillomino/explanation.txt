the fillomino problem is essentially a brute force problem that can be optimised very heavily. The concept is that each cell has the same amount of surrounding neigbours connected in a group as its given value. Cells with 1 have only one neighbour being itself. Cells with 2 have only 2 being itself and another neighbour. The problem is solved by finding the possiblities for each cell and using backtracking to solve.
